    <h2 class="about">About me:</h2>
    <p>I am a full-time working mom, and that in itself is enough to keep me busy enough, but I recently realized that I needed a hobby to not only be able to create, but also as a way to decompress.  If there is anything custom you are wanting made, I can mostly likely do it.  I can do local pickup, or I can ship you your items for an additional cost.  I would love to create something amazing for you.  I can make decorated and framed wooden signs for indoors, vertical welcome signs for your porch, kids growth charts, circle wooden signs to hang on your front door, mailbox decals, wall decals, canvas prints, faux leather earrings, leather key wristlet, custom t-shirt designs, and so much more. </p>
